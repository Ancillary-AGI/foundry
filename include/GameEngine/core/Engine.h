/**
 * @file Engine.h
 * @brief Main engine class and core functionality for FoundryEngine
 * @author FoundryEngine Team
 * @date 2024
 * @version 1.0.0
 *
 * This file contains the core Engine class that serves as the central hub of the FoundryEngine.
 * The Engine class manages the entire game lifecycle, coordinates all engine systems, and provides
 * the main game loop. It implements a singleton pattern to ensure global access while maintaining
 * thread safety and proper resource management.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - System initialization and lifecycle management
 * - Main game loop execution (update/render cycle)
 * - Platform abstraction and cross-platform compatibility
 * - Memory management and resource cleanup
 * - Scene and world management coordination
 * - System registration and execution ordering
 *
 * Architecture:
 * The engine follows an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture with modular systems
 * that can be added/removed dynamically. All platform-specific code is abstracted through
 * the PlatformInterface, ensuring the core engine remains platform-agnostic.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * // Initialize engine
 * Engine& engine = Engine::getInstance();
 * if (!engine.initialize()) {
 *     return -1; // Initialization failed
 * }
 *
 * // Run main game loop
 * engine.run();
 *
 * // Cleanup
 * engine.shutdown();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Singleton access is thread-safe
 * - Main game loop should run on single thread
 * - Systems may have their own threading requirements
 *
 * Dependencies:
 * - World for ECS management
 * - Renderer for graphics rendering
 * - AudioManager for audio processing
 * - InputManager for user input
 * - PhysicsWorld for physics simulation
 * - ScriptEngine for scripting support
 * - AssetManager for resource management
 * - SceneManager for scene hierarchy
 * - UIManager for user interface
 * - NetworkManager for multiplayer
 * - ProfileManager for performance monitoring

/**
 * @class Engine
 * @brief Core game engine class managing all systems and the main game loop
 *
 * The Engine class is the central component of FoundryEngine, responsible for:
 * - Initializing and managing all engine subsystems
 * - Running the main game loop with proper timing and frame rate control
 * - Coordinating updates and rendering across all systems
 * - Providing access to core engine functionality
 * - Managing scene transitions and world state
 * - Handling pause/resume and quit functionality
 *
 * This class implements the singleton pattern to ensure only one engine instance
 * exists throughout the application's lifetime. The engine coordinates the execution
 * of all registered systems in the correct order to maintain proper game simulation.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Singleton pattern for global engine access
 * - Modular system architecture with dynamic management
 * - Platform-agnostic core with abstracted platform layer
 * - Proper resource management and cleanup
 * - Frame-rate independent updates with delta time
 * - Scene management and world coordination
 * - Performance profiling and monitoring
 * - Pause/resume functionality for game state management
